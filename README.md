# Eigenkit

## Overview

Eigenkit is a linear algebra library for C++ programming language.
This library it's still under development, but it's already possible to observe how the structure of the first completed version will be. Currently, it only offers a variety of methods for dense matrices, linear systems and quaternions. Many other important features, such as methods for sparse matrices, will be added with subsequent releases.

## Requirements and Download

Eigenkit is compatible with any compiler and doesn't have any dependencies other than the C++ standard library.
So, if you want to use it, you can simply download the source code containing the header files (since they are the only files needed to compile the library) and add them to your project.
