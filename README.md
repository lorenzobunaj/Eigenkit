### Eigenkit

## Overview
Eigenkit is a linear algebra library for C++ programming language.
This library it's still under development, but it's already possible to observe how the structure of the first completed version will be. Currently, it only offers a variety of methods for dense matrices, linear systems and geometric transformations. Many other important features, such as methods for sparse matrices, will be added with subsequent releases.
