# Eigenkit

Eigenkit is a linear algebra library for C++ programming language.
This library it's still under development, but it's already possible to observe how the structure of the first completed version will be. Currently, it only offers a variety of methods for dense matrices, linear systems and quaternions. Many other important features, such as methods for sparse matrices, will be added with subsequent releases.

## Features

- Supports many [C++ Standard Numerics Library](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric) functions and types, like [complex](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/complex).
- Compatible with any compiler.
- Easily extensible.
- Open source

## Requirements and Download

Eigenkit is compatible with any compiler and doesn't have any dependencies other than the [C++ Standard Library](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/standard_library).  
So, if you want to use it, you can [download](https://eigenkit.org/docs/getting-started/download.html) the Eigenkit source's latest version and extract it. Once you've done that, you'll simply add the source code containing the header files to your project.
